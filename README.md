# The Green Mountain Pi is a network and security device with multiple layers of functionality.
# Our goal is to implement multiple methods and applications of security on the RPi and on this UI screen for the user to interact with.
# For network monitoring, we use Raspbian system commands and Nmap to locate networks and perform two different scans.
# To increase cyber security, we implemented a firewall, the antimalware software Rootkit Hunter, and a virtual private network switch.
# Our intrustion detection system is developed off of using iptables to configure firewall settings and the Rootkit Hunter software.
