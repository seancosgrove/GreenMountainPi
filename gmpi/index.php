    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <p>The Green Mountain Pi is a network and security device with many layers of functionality.
    Our goal is to implement multiple methods and applications of security on the RPi and on this UI screen for the user to interact with.
    For network monitoring, we are looking into using Nmap, a traffic filter and creating a multi-router network connection.
    To increase cyber security, we will implement a firewall, antivirus and antimalware software, an intrusion detection/prevention system, and a virtual private network switch.
    For physical security, we plan to hook up a camera and get its live feed on the UI.
